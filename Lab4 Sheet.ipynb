    "## The MNIST Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "MNIST is a dataset developed by Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes and Christopher Burges for evaluating machine learning models on the handwritten digit classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was constructed from a number of scanned document dataset available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This is where the name for the dataset comes from, as the Modified NIST or MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Images of digits were taken from a variety of scanned documents, normalized in size and centred. This makes it an excellent dataset for evaluating models, allowing the developer to focus on the machine learning with very little data cleaning or preparation required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each image is a 28 by 28 pixel square (784 pixels total). A standard spit of the dataset is used to evaluate and compare models, where 60,000 images are used to train a model and a separate set of 10,000 images are used to test it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a digit recognition task. As such there are 10 digits (0 to 9) or 10 classes to predict. Results are reported using prediction error, which is nothing more than the inverted classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent results achieve a prediction error of less than 1%. State-of-the-art prediction error of approximately 0.2% can be achieved with large Convolutional Neural Networks. There is a listing of the state-of-the-art results and links to the relevant papers on the MNIST and other datasets on [Rodrigo Benensonâ€™s webpage](http://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/classification_datasets_results.html#4d4e495354)."

    "## Loading the MNIST dataset in PyTorch and torchvision\n",
    "\n",
    "The `torchvision` library provides a convenience method for loading the MNIST dataset. The dataset can be downloaded automatically the first time this function is called and is stored in a location of your choice. This is very handy for developing and testing deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate how easy it is to load the MNIST dataset, we will first write a little script to download and visualize the first 4 images in the training dataset. __Read through the following code and then go-ahead and run it__."

Note how we use the PyTorch 'Functional API' for stateless operations like applying the ReLU; we could construct a `torch.nn.ReLU` in the constructor and save it in an instance variable instead, but ultimately this would lead to more lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `nn.Module` class defines a instance variable called `training` that is set to `True` when the model is being trained and `False` when it is being evaluated after being trained. In our model definition we've used a softmax activation function on the output layer to turn the outputs into probability-like values, but have only set this to be enabled when we are not training the model. We've done this because we will use PyTorch's implementation of Cross Entropy Loss (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`) during training which implicitly adds a softmax before a logarithmic loss (technically it adds a log-softmax activation followed by a negative log-likelihood loss as this has much better numerical properties). If you've used a library like Keras before you should note that this approach is different to the one taken there - Keras expects you to explicitly add a `Softmax` layer to use with its `categorical_crossentropy` loss.\n",

    "## Training and Evaluating the Model\n",
    "We can now fit and evaluate the model. One of the design decisions of PyTorch is that everything should be explicit so we have full control over our models and the training process. This means that we actually need to write the model training loop by hand, and perform each of the various operations (perform the forward-pass, compute the loss, perform the backward-pass, and update the weights). In the code below we'll fit the model to the data over 10 epochs using batches of 128 images provided by the `DataLoader` defined previously. We'll make use of the ADAM optimiser as it broadly tends to work well practically despite its limitations. Running the code below should take just a couple of minutes to complete the training."

    "You've now got to a stage where you've successfully implemented, trained and evaluated a neural network in PyTorch. You will have noticed that whilst defining the model was done in very few lines of code, that you actually had to do quite a lot of work to train and evaluate the model. Whilst the ability to have complete control over training and evaluation is useful (you'll see examples in later labs, and for the coursework you might come across situations where this is an absolute necessity), it can become rather tedious if you just want to perform a standard training and evaluation run. \n",

Torchbearer is a model training and evaluation library that is designed to massively reduce the amount of code you need to write whilst still allowing full control over the process. \n",
